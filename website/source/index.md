### What it is

Utilities, utilities, utilities!

Everyone needs utilities and until things like
[cl-utilities][] get going (and probably even after!),
projects need to have them nearby. Metatilities is
[metabang.com][9]'s set of core utilities. It includes much
of what you might expect and other stuff too. These are used
in [CL-Containers][], [CL-Graph][], [CL-MathStats][],
[CL-Variates][], and [TINAA][]. You are welcome to use
them too. Some documentation is [available][15] and more is
on the way.

### Mailing Lists

* [devel-list][]: A list for questions, patches, bug
  reports, and so on; It's for everything other than
  announcements.

### Where is it

A [darcs][] repository is available. You'll need
[metatilities-base][] and [moptilities][] too. The commands
to get them are listed below:

    darcs get http://common-lisp.net/project/metatilities
    darcs get http://common-lisp.net/project/metatilities-base
    darcs get http://common-lisp.net/project/moptilities

Metatilities is [ASDF installable][asdf-install]. Its CLiki home is
right [where][cliki-home] you'd expect.

There's also a handy [gzipped tar file][tarball].
